# Data Visualization : Visualising Pakistan Drone Attacks

## Summary 
The United States has targeted militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas [FATA] and the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KPK] in Pakistan via its Predator and Reaper drone strikes since year 2004. Pakistan Body Count (www.PakistanBodyCount.org) is the oldest and most accurate running tally of drone strikes in Pakistan. The dateset used in this visualization project provides the count of the people killed and injured in drone strikes, including the ones who died later in hospitals or homes due to injuries caused or aggravated by drone strikes, making it the most authentic source for drone related data in this region.
