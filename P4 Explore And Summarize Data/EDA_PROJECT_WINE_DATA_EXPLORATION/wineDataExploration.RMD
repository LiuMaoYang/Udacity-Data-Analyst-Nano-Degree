White Wine Data Exploration
========================================================
This tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

This Report explores the White Wine dataset to findout which chemical properties influence the quality of wines.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
setwd('F:/chaitanya/eda-course-materials')
wines <- read.csv('wineQualityWhites.csv')
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
dim(wines)
```

```{r}
str(wines)
```

```{r}
summary(wines)
```
Now lets explore the distribution of acidity in our samples.
```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=fixed.acidity),data=wines)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25,color="black")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3,15,0.5))
```

```{r}

ggplot(aes(x=quality),data=wines)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1,color='black')+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3,9,1))
```
